# [This.State](http://this.state.surge.sh/)


## Project Description

**this.state** is a site that gives the public access to real-time bills and legislation that congress just passed.  It will allow the user insight on how each party voted.  Upcoming bills will also be displayed, as well as a search functionality that will allow the user to search for bills according to a specific topic.

The site will have a directory of every senator and house member by state where a user can access a specific politician's contact information and website, and offer statistics on each of their voting records (including how many votes they've missed, their percentage of voting against party) and their spending habits.  Note that statistics are only available for congress members of the 115th congress and only reflect stats from year 2018- contact info will still be available for new members, but their statistics are not available yet.

## MVP/PostMVP

### MVP

- Display CurrentBills  component in the homepage
- NavMain bar with that routes to /Home, /BillsArchive, and /CongressHome
- /BillsArchive route will contain a SearchBillsForm component, user types keyword to search.
- BillResults component will be routed after user hits the search button
- /senate and /house routes will have a similar hierarchy:
  * a CongressStat component that renders the stats of the previous year, and an an OnClick function on the name of the politician that will lead to his ContactList component
  * a FilterByStateForm component, a PoliticiansList component that shows all the politicians of each state
- Header and Footer Components
- PressRelease component displays most recent press releases

### PostMVP

- a filter by party function
- a filter by next re-election function
- a search for a specific bill function (needs a bill ID)
- a specific roll-call vote function (needs bill ID)
- a dropdown box where the user selects a specific state
- an OnClick function on the name of the politician that will lead to his ContactList

## Code Snippet

- The code below will render a red box if the politician is a republican, or a blue box if they are democrat.

```
<div className="partybox"
style={{ backgroundColor: x.party==="R" ? "#ee252c" : "#123cf4" }} />
```

- The code below renders a prop if that data is available, or returns nothing if the API does not provide it.  It is done for a phone number, twitter account, facebook account, website, and contact page.  The user can also click on the link and it will redirect them to that link.

```
<div className="contact">
  {x.roles[0].phone === null ? null :
    (<div>phone: <span>{x.roles[0].phone}</span></div>)}
  {x.twitter_account === null ? null :
    (<div>twitter: <span><a className="links" href={"https://twitter.com/"+x.twitter_account} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{x.twitter_account}</a></span></div>)}
  {x.facebook_account === null ? null :
    (<div>facebook: <span><a className="links" href={"https://facebook.com/"+x.facebook_account} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{x.facebook_account}</a></span></div>)}
  {x.url === null ? null :
    (<div>website: <span><a className="links" href={x.url} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{x.url}</a></span></div>)}
  {x.roles[0].contact_form === null ? null :
    (<div>contact: <span><a className="links" href={x.roles[0].contact_form} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{x.roles[0].contact_form}</a></span></div>)}
</div>
```

## Issues and Resolutions

**ERROR**: all the forms are linked together.  So if you are in the archives component and search for a keyword, the forms in the senate and house of reps component will also search for that keyword and error out.                               
**RESOLUTION**: creating different handle submits for each form.
